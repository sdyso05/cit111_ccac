## About Me
My name is Sara and I am very popular but only on the internet.

My life goal is to purchase an abandoned defensive military fortification like a bunker or missile silo, refurbish it and live there forever, completely isolated from the rest of the world. 

In my free time, I like to bake, sew, and search for cryptids in the tri-state area.
